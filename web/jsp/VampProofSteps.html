More details on these can be found in section 2.3 of a Vampire

<ul>
    <li>Inputs:
    <ul>
        <li>input: an input formula
        <li>negated conjecture: the conjecture in negated form
        <li>equality/theory axiom: assumed axioms not in the input
    </ul>
    <li>Preprocessing:
    <ul>
        <li>flattening, rectify, *nf transformation, skolemisation: clausification steps (see [10])
        <li>FOOL *: elimination of FOOL elements (see [3, 4])
        <li>equality proxy *: used to axiomatise equality (necessary for InstGen)
        <li>definition unfolding, unused predicate definition removal, pure predicate removal:
        eliminating function and predicate definitions and pure predicates
        <li>predicate definition introduction, definition folding: naming subformulas (see Section 3)
        <li>general splitting: splitting a clause by naming subclauses (see Section 3)
        <li>inequality splitting: split a clause based on an inequality
    </ul>
    <li>Simplification:
    <ul>
        <li>duplicate literal removal, trivial inequality removal, distinct equality removal: literal removal operations
        <li>evaluation: evaluating ground theory terms
    </ul>
    <li>Superposition and Resolution Calculus:
    <ul>
        <li>resolution
        <li>subsumption resolution
        <li>superposition
        <li>equality factoring
        <li>equality resolution
        <li>backward/forward demodulation
        <li>unit resulting resolution
    </ul>
    <li>Other:
    <ul>
        <li>avatar *: steps relating to AVATAR, see Sec. 5 (previously splitting *)
        <li>extensionality resolution: a special inference step (see [2])
        <li>instance generation: from the InstGen calculus (see [8])
        <li>global subsumption: a useful simplification step (see [7, 8])
    </ul>
</ul><P>
