Follow below steps to compile eprover in windows and distribute it as a standalone windows binary.
 
1. Compile in cygwin 
	1.1 To Download and Install cygwin visit https://www.cygwin.com/install.html
	1.2 Select following packages while installing 
		gcc-core: GNU Compiler Collection (C,OpenMP)
		gcc-g++: GNU Compiler Collection (C++)
		make: The GNU version of the 'make' utility
	1.3 Download eprover source code from http://wwwlehre.dhbw-stuttgart.de/~sschulz/E/Download.html
	1.4 Extract the source code to C:\cygwin64\home\<user_name>\E
	1.5 Start cygwin terminal and cd to ~/<user_name>/E
    1.6 run command 'make' 	
2. Copy compiled binaries in windows
	2.1 In windows explorer go to C:\cygwin64\home\<user_name>\E\PROVER
	2.2 Copy eprover.exe and eprover_ltb_runner.exe to the folder D:\EPROVER_BIN

Note: I am using D:\EPROVER_BIN as a folder to store binaries. 
you can use your own path but remember to change everywhere accordingly. 
Just don't choose a folder with spaces in the path.

3. Copy required libaries
	1.1 Copy below files from cygwin's bin folder located at C:\cygwin64\bin
		cyggcc_s-1.dll
		cygiconv-2.dll 
		cygintl-8.dll 
		cygncursesw-10.dll 
		cygreadline7.dll 
		cygwin1.dll
		ls.exe 
		sh.exe
	1.2 Paste these files to D:\EPROVER_BIN\bin 	
	(Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14641191/cygwin-trying-to-run-dos-command-in-c-language )
4. Add path 'D:\EPROVER_BIN\bin' to System Variable 'Path'
5. Set Environment variable TMPDIR to D:\temp (Or any path of your choice)
	Make sure to create temp directory before hand. Eprover wont try to create it and will throw an error.

You can use D:\EPROVER_BIN\eprover.exe and D:\EPROVER_BIN\eprover_ltb_runner.exe or can add D:\EPROVER_BIN to System Path to run from anywhere.

Test: 
1. eprover.exe
Assuming that eprover v2.0 is extracted at 'C:\cygwin64\home\<user_name>\E', you can run a smoke test that is shipped with eprover v2.0.
Run following command from D:\EPROVER_BIN
eprover.exe --auto --proof-object --assume-incompleteness /cygdrive/c/cygwin64/home/<user_name>/E/EXAMPLE_PROBLEMS/SMOKETEST/socrates.p

2. eprover_ltb_runner.exe
e_ltb_runner.exe -v --interactive <Path to EBatchConfig in Windows>\EBatchConfig.txt /cygdrive/d/EPROVER_BIN/eprover.exe
Creating EBatchConfig.txt is out of this document's scope.

Troubleshooting tips:
1.	In cygwin you can access host Windows files using /cygdrive/<drive letter>/folder 
	e.g. use /cygdrive/d/EPROVER_BIN to access files at D:\EPROVER_BIN. 
	Again don't use paths with spaces
